State management has always been a hot topic in Flutter and we already have a lot of options to help us with this. It's not my first try in this adventure since I already created two packages before, about state management.

I've been in the Flutter world since late 2017 and so far I've never been entirely satisfied by the options we had, that's why I have been working on my own to explore other solutions.

After more than six years of experience in Flutter and multiple trials in the search of a better solution for me, I have now a pretty solid idea of what would be a state management package which would suit my needs. And maybe it will also be useful for you too!
